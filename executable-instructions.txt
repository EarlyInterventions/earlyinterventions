If your Python application requires multiple external packages, you can use PyInstaller's --hidden-import option to include them in the stand-alone executable. Here's an 
example of how you could do this:

1. First, install PyInstaller using pip:
pip install pyinstaller

2. Next, navigate to the directory containing your Python files and run the following command:
pyinstaller --onefile main.py
This command tells PyInstaller to create a stand-alone executable of main.py, which is the entry point to your application. PyInstaller will automatically include any other 
Python files that main.py imports.

3. If your application has multiple external dependencies (e.g. packages that you've installed with pip), you can include them in the PyInstaller command using the 
--hidden-import option. For example:
pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import package1 --hidden-import package2 main.py
This command tells PyInstaller to include package1 and package2 in the executable, even though they're not directly imported by main.py.
We'll need ldap3, sklearn, pyqt, pandas, MORE HERE?


PyInstaller will create a new directory called dist, which will contain the executable file. The executable file will have the same name as your script, but with an .exe extension.
Your application is now packaged as a stand-alone executable that can be downloaded and run on a Windows machine. Note that if your application has any data files or other 
non-Python resources (e.g. images, configuration files),
